### Built With

- [Fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

We assume that you have a amazon ec2 instance.
In this [tutorial]([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmkU-qYoP19uM3ueLyhxEMg](https://youtu.be/_719QPPARUw)) we have used ubuntu with [aws free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) and instance type is t2.micro(1 gb ram).

After you enter the instance by ssh or any other method update the instance first by using below command:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

Command to install python :

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pip
```


Command to install git to clone this repository :

```sh
sudo apt install git
```

Command to install git to clone this repository you can use your repository git url which you want to host :

```sh
sudo git clone https://github.com/smurfcoders/fastapi-hosting.git
```

Command to change location into the cloned folder you can use your repository name :

```sh
cd fastapi-hosting
```

Command to install all the requirements required for the project to run in our case we have created requirements.txt file you can also create your own requirements :

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Command to run the API :

```sh
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

After running go to AWS instance --> Security tab --> Edit inbound rules --> create rule --> Enable access from anywhere.<br>
Go to the public ip provided by the instance add :8000 in the end as our api is running at that particular port.

That's it you can now access your Fastapi from anywhere.
